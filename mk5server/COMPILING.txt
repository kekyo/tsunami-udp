 In Makefile.am, "mk5tsunamid_CC = g++" is not supported by automake.
 StreamStor library libssapi.a requires g++ version 3.x instead of gcc.

 To compile mk5server:
    ./configure
    cd common
    edit Makefile   : change "CC = gcc" into "CC = g++"
    make
    cd ../mk5server
    edit Makefile   : change "CC = gcc" into "CC = g++"
    make

 (for quick libssapi.a link check: g++ mk5api.c ../common/libtsunami_common.a -lm ../common/libssapi.a -lpthread)
