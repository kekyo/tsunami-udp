 * This file needs to be manually edited (yuck...) every time before you
 * commit something to the CVS.
 *
 * The commit/build number in this file will be printed out by the
 * tsunami applications on start. That allows people to better control
 * which CVS build version they are using since the number is the same
 * on all machines after a 'cvs update' or checkout.
